# Video-Spam-Prankware
Prankware that spams a custom video to random coordinates on the screen in a continuous loop.

This is my first real python project.

run.py is the file to be executed
main.py contains all functions and logic

How does it work in detail?

Contents of main.py
The screen size is read, the coordinates of the custom video to be played are randomized, custom audio and video are played synchronously and played as a whole in the foreground.

Contents of run.py
The file main.py is executed in a loop a custom amount of times.
